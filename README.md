# Genetic Piecewise Linear Approximation

To understand **GPLA**(Genetic Piecewise Linear Approximation), you should know the Piecewise Linear Approximation.

## Piecewise Linear Approximation

**PLA**(Piecewise Linear Approximation) is one method to approximate a single valude function of one variable in terms of a sequence of linear segments.


### Limitations

Creating a PLA creates its own optimization problem. 

Obviously the best piecewise linear approximation would use an infinite number of linear pieces to fit the curve.
